# Staging area for results


## Operator
### Sequential vs Random vs Mixed crossover
Function 11
Results show that sequential crossover converges faster (6/8) to a less optimal results
Randomized crossover converges slower to a more optimal result, can lose results
Mixed converges fast to a far more optimal result

### Cooling
Using mutation cooling prevents destructive mutations (which are filtered, but add to runtime), and improves convergence (less generations)
