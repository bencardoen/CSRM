% Context 
Simulation offers key insights into the behavior of real world processes. The simulation of ever increasingly complex models comes is limited by its significant computational cost.
% What we have now
% SR is an interesting combination of a discrete combinatorial and continuous optimization problem.
A surrogate model approximates the responses of a simulation model at a lower computational cost. 
Symbolic Regression (SR) is an interesting combination of a discrete combinatorial and continuous optimization problem, it is capable of evolving analytical expressions as surrogate models. 
The advantage SR offers over other surrogate techniques are transparency and insight into the dynamics of the feature set. %dynamics change word
% What we want
Convergence and accuracy are open problems in SR. The challenge is finding an algorithm that can handle the discrete and continuous problems.
% Our solution
Advances in the field of metaheuristics warrant an in depth study into the applications of these algorithms to the SR problem. 
Our approach is a hybrid of a combinatorial algorithm and a optimization algorithm.
The change in rate of convergence of several strategies will be analyzed and contrasted against the change in computational cost.
