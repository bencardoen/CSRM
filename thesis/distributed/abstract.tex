Symbolic regression (SR) builds algebraic expressions for an underlying model using a set of input-output data.
Amongst its advantages are the ability to interpret the resulting expressions, determine important model features based on the presence in the expressions, and gain insights into the behavior of the resulting model (e.g. extrema). A key algorithm in SR is genetic programming (GP) to optimize the search process, though convergence characteristics are still an open issue.
In this work, we elaborate on a distributed GP-SR implementation and evaluate the effect of communication topologies on the convergence of the algorithm.
We evaluate a grid, tree and random topology with the aim of finding a balance between diffusion and concentration.
We use a variation of k-fold cross validation to estimate the accuracy to predict unknown data points. This validation executes in parallel with the algorithm, thus combining the advantages of the cross validation with the increase in search space coverage. We introduce an incremental approach where the SR tool can start on partial data. This saves time, as the tool can be used in parallel with the simulator, which generates the input-output data. It also enables a human expert in the modeling loop, where partial results of the SR tool can be used to tune the design of experiments. We validate our work on several test problems and a use case on epidemiological simulations for the spread of measles.
