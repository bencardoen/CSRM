Symbolic regression (SR) buils a symbolic expression for an underlying model using a set of input-output data.
Amongst its advantages are the ability for a practitioner to interpret the resulting expression, determine important model features by their usage in the expression, and gain insights into the behavior of the resulting model (e.g. extrema). A key algorithms in SR is genetic programming (GP). The convergence characteristics of SR using GP are still an open issue.
In this work use a distributed GP-SR implementation to evaluate the effect of communication topologies on the convergence of the algorithm.
We introduce and evaluate a tree topology with the aim of finding a new balance between diffusion and concentration.
We use a variation of k-fold cross validation to estimate how accurate a solution is in predicting unknown data points. This validation executes in parallel with the algorithm, thus combining the advantages of the cross validation with the increase in search space coverage. We introduce an incremental approach where the SR tool can start on partial data. This saves the practitioner time, as the tool can be used in parallel with the experiment generating the data. It also allows for a human expert in the loop, where the partial results of the SR tool can be used to further tune the experiment design. We validate our work on several test problems and a real world use case involving epidemiological simulation for the spread of measles.
