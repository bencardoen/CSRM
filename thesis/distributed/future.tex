Future work can take any of three directions. First our distributed architecture allows for a each process to use a different metaheuristic, creating a heterogeneous set of communicating algorithms. A cooperative set of optimizations algorithms could offer an optimal solution for all problem instances by balancing the disadvantages and advantages of each algorithm. 
Second, the tool can easily be extended with new topologies and spreading policies to further investigate their effects on convergence and accuracy. Lastly, we can approximate incremental design of experiment by making use of the collapsing property of latin hypercubes. By reducing the number of parameters and fixing the other values, we avoid the naive linear division approach we thus far have used in seeding the tool and possibly maintain the space filling characteristics of the LHD.
