I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Jan Broeckhove for his continued guidance and support. 
I appreciated the advice of Sean Stijven and Lander Willem.
Discussing my thesis with Elise Kuylen, Tim Tuijn and Stijn Manhaeve helped me solve issues in my implementation and stay sane. On a personal level I would like to thank my family for supporting me during my degree and thesis. 
Finally, as no writer is without muse, Debbie Derantere continues to inspire my writing.
