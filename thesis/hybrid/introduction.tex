\subsection{Overview}
% What we will discuss and where
% Solution : I'll know it when I see it
% Not focussed on what works, but on what doesn't
% No black box, want to see how fitness evolves.

\subsection{Symbolic Regression}
% Intro to SR

\subsubsection{Compared to other techniques}
% Not a black box, expression can offer insight, use as classifier.

\subsubsection{Interpreting results}
%

\subsubsection{Applications}
% Link with simulation

\subsection{Convergence}
\subsubsection{Measures}
% Questions for the practitioner
% Is it an issue, and why
% measures
% Accuracy versus convergence
% The question practitioner puts is ...

\subsection{Metaheuristics}

\subsection{Genetic Programming}
% Overview of GP and how GP can be applied to SR
% What is it, why GP, alternatives (use them for related work

\subsection{Constant optimization problem}
% Describe it shortly

\subsection{Distributed}
% why distribute, apart from speed gain
% Approaches, what's the selling point
