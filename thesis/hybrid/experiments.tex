% Show the effect of cooling
% Show the effect of depth sensitive

% Exclusive experiments
\subsection{Constant Folding}
\subsubsection{Savings}
% Show effect of constant folding savings
\subsubsection{Effect on convergence}
% Show fitness effect of constant folding

\subsection{Constant optimization}
We look at the effect constant optimization using different algorithms has on different configurations of the tool. The measures used in the comparison are best fitness on training and test data, mean fitness on training and test data, and optimization cost.

\subsection{Conclusion}
% Which algorithm is 'better' and how do you define better ?
% When and why do they fail ?
% Add section about overfitting, and explanation
