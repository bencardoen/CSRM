In this section we will use our tool on a real world use case. % ref stride
\subsection{Problem statement}
We want to use symbolic regression on the output of a simulator. The parameter space of the simulator is huge, and simulation instance are computationally expensive. We would like to obtain symbolic expressions relating parameters values to simulator output. These expressions can be used to gain insight into which parameters are correlated, which have a larger effect on output and which are irrelevant.

% List DOE technique used and parameter configuration
% Why this technique
% Briefly list configuration
\subsection{Incremental support}
We will use the incremental support built in into CSRM to apply SR to the simulator in tandem. 
\subsection{Results}
% Fitness obtained, correlation, use visualization
